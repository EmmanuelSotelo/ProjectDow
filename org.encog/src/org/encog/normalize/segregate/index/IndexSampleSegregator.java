/**
 * An index segregator is used to segregate the data according to its index.
 * Nothing about the data is actually compared. This makes the index range
 * segregator very useful for breaking the data into training and validation
 * sets. For example, you could very easily determine that 70% of the data is
 * for training, and 30% for validation.
 * 
 * This segregator takes a starting and ending index, as well as a smple size.
 * Everything that is between these two indexes will be used.  The sample 
 * repeats over and over.  For example, if you choose a sample size of 10, 
 * and a beginning index of 0 and an ending index of 5, you would get
 * half of the first 10 element, then half of the next ten, and so on.
