/**
 * Both the multiplicative and z-axis normalization types allow a group of 
 * outputs to be adjusted so that the "vector length" is 1.  Both go about it
 * in different ways.  Certain types of neural networks require a vector length 
 * of 1.
 * 
 * Z-Axis normalization is usually a better choice than multiplicative.    
 * However, multiplicative can perform better than Z-Axis when all of the 
 * values are near zero most of the time.  This can cause the "synthetic value"
 * that z-axis uses to dominate and skew the answer.
 * 
 *  Z-Axis gets its name from 3D computer graphics, where there is a Z-Axis
 *  extending from the plane created by the X and Y axes.  It has nothing to 
 *  do with z-scores or the z-transform of signal theory.
 *  
 *  To implement Z-Axis normalization a scaling factor must be created to multiply
 *  each of the inputs against.  Additionally, a synthetic field must be added.
 *  It is very important that this synthetic field be added to any z-axis
 *  group that you might use.  The synthetic field is represented by the
 *  OutputFieldZAxisSynthetic class.
