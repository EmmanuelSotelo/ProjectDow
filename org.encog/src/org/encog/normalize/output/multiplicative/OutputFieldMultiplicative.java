/**
 * Both the multiplicative and z-axis normalization types allow a group of 
 * outputs to be adjusted so that the "vector length" is 1.  Both go about it
 * in different ways.  Certain types of neural networks require a vector length 
 * of 1.
 * 
 * The multiplicative normalization is more simple than Z-Axis normalization.  
 * Almost always Z=Axis normalization is a better choice.  However, 
 * multiplicative can perform better than Z-Axis when all of the values
 * are near zero most of the time.  This can cause the "synthetic value"
 * that z-axis uses to dominate and skew the answer.
 * 
 *  Multiplicative normalization works by calculating the vector length of
 *  the input fields and dividing each by that value.  This also presents 
 *  a problem, as the magnitude of the original fields is not used.  For 
 *  example, multiplicative normalization would not distinguish between
 *  (-2,1,3) and (-10,5,15).  Both would result in the same output.
