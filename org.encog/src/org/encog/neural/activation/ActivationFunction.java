 * This interface allows various activation functions to be used with the neural
 * network. Activation functions are applied to the output from each layer of a
 * neural network. Activation functions scale the output into the desired range.
 * 
 * Methods are provided both to process the activation function, as well as the
 * derivative of the function. Some training algorithms, particularly back
 * propagation, require that it be possible to take the derivative of the
 * activation function.
 * 
 * Not all activation functions support derivatives. If you implement an
 * activation function that is not derivable then an exception should be thrown
 * inside of the derivativeFunction method implementation.
 * 
 * Non-derivable activation functions are perfectly valid, they simply cannot be
 * used with every training algorithm.
