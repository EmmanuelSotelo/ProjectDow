/**
 * This class implements a neural network. This class works in conjunction the
 * Layer classes. Layers are added to the BasicNetwork to specify the structure
 * of the neural network.
 * 
 * The first layer added is the input layer, the final layer added is the output
 * layer. Any layers added between these two layers are the hidden layers.
 * 
 * The network structure is stored in the structure member. It is important to
 * call:
 * 
 * network.getStructure().finalizeStructure();
 * 
 * Once the neural network has been completely constructed.
