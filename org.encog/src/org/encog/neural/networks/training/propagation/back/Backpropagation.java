/**
 * This class implements a backpropagation training algorithm for feed forward
 * neural networks. It is used in the same manner as any other training class
 * that implements the Train interface.
 * 
 * Backpropagation is a common neural network training algorithm. It works by
 * analyzing the error of the output of the neural network. Each neuron in the
 * output layer's contribution, according to weight, to this error is
 * determined. These weights are then adjusted to minimize this error. This
 * process continues working its way backwards through the layers of the neural
 * network.
 * 
 * This implementation of the backpropagation algorithm uses both momentum and a
 * learning rate. The learning rate specifies the degree to which the weight
 * matrixes will be modified through each iteration. The momentum specifies how
 * much the previous learning iteration affects the current. To use no momentum
 * at all specify zero.
 * 
 * One primary problem with backpropagation is that the magnitude of the partial
 * derivative is often detrimental to the training of the neural network. The
 * other propagation methods of Manhatten and Resilient address this issue in
 * different ways. In general, it is suggested that you use the resilient
 * propagation technique for most Encog training tasks over back propagation.
