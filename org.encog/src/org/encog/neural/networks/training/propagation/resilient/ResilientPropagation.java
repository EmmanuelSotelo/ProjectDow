/**
 * One problem with the backpropagation algorithm is that the magnitude of the
 * partial derivative is usually too large or too small. Further, the learning
 * rate is a single value for the entire neural network. The resilient
 * propagation learning algorithm uses a special update value(similar to the
 * learning rate) for every neuron connection. Further these update values are
 * automatically determined, unlike the learning rate of the backpropagation
 * algorithm.
 * 
 * For most training situations, we suggest that the resilient propagation
 * algorithm (this class) be used for training.
 * 
 * There are a total of three parameters that must be provided to the resilient
 * training algorithm. Defaults are provided for each, and in nearly all cases,
 * these defaults are acceptable. This makes the resilient propagation algorithm
 * one of the easiest and most efficient training algorithms available.
 * 
 * The optional parameters are:
 * 
 * zeroTolerance - How close to zero can a number be to be considered zero. The
 * default is 0.00000000000000001.
 * 
 * initialUpdate - What are the initial update values for each matrix value. The
 * default is 0.1.
 * 
 * maxStep - What is the largest amount that the update values can step. The
 * default is 50.
 * 
 * 
 * Usually you will not need to use these, and you should use the constructor
 * that does not require them.
