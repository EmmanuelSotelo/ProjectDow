/**
 * One problem that the backpropagation technique has is that the magnitude of
 * the partial derivative may be calculated too large or too small. The
 * Manhattan update algorithm attempts to solve this by using the partial
 * derivative to only indicate the sign of the update to the weight matrix. The
 * actual amount added or subtracted from the weight matrix is obtained from a
 * simple constant. This constant must be adjusted based on the type of neural
 * network being trained. In general, start with a higher constant and decrease
 * it as needed.
 * 
 * The Manhattan update algorithm can be thought of as a simplified version of
 * the resilient algorithm. The resilient algorithm uses more complex techniques
 * to determine the update value.
